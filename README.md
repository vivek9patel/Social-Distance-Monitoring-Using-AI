# Social-Distance-Monitoring-Using-AI
We are going to develop 2 Mobile Apps to fight against COVID-19.

## Description :
### 1) Corona Soldier
* This will be used by **government/police authority** for governing social distancing.

### 2) Corona Setu
* This will be used by **citizens**. We are providing them privilege to upload photos where they find disobedience of Social Distancing. 
* Along with this we will provide various information in our App like Current Statistics of Corona in India, Precautions to be taken and many more.
* So a unique idea of 2 APPs is presented by our team.

## Hardware and Software Requirements :
* Drone with Cameras and GPS Module 

## Process Flow :
* Drone will monitor social distancing through **Corona Soldier App**.This will generate systemetic report of it.
* Citizens will complain about any social gatherings around their homes through **Corona Setu App**.Our system will filter the request and will delete the fake requests.
* It will give valid data of requests/complains and gives them to goverment authorities.
* In this way government will get report of disobdience of social distancing from two source, that it drone & citizens.
* Now, Goverment can take action with the help of this data of complains, and this will be our process flow.
